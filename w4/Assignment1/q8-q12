-- List the staff members (their firstname, a space and then the lastname as one column called name) who have successfully sold policies (i.e., enforced policies)
-- that only cover one brand of vehicle. Order the result by pid in ascending order.

-- Q9

-- Q10
-- 简单函数用法


-- returns the total number of (distinct) staff that have worked (i.e., sells, rates, underwrites) on the given policy
select *
from policy
where pno = 1;
-- sell is in sno, rates is in rated_by, underwrite is in underwites_by

with write_by as (
    -- underwritten_by
    select p.pno, firstname, lastname
    from staff
             join underwritten_by ub on staff.sid = ub.sid
             join underwriting_record on ub.urid = underwriting_record.urid
             join policy p on underwriting_record.pno = p.pno
             join person p2 on staff.pid = p2.pid
),
     rate_by as (
         -- rate
         select p.pno, firstname, lastname
         from staff
                  join rated_by rb on staff.sid = rb.sid
                  join rating_record on rb.rid = rating_record.rid
                  join coverage c on rating_record.coid = c.coid
                  join policy p on c.pno = p.pno
                  join person p2 on staff.pid = p2.pid
     ),
     sell_by as (
         -- sells
         select p.pno, firstname, lastname
         from staff
                  join policy p on staff.sid = p.sid
                  join person p2 on staff.pid = p2.pid)


select *
from rate_by
where pno = 5
union

select *
from write_by
where pno = 5

union

select *
from sell_by
where pno = 5;



-- 怎么用函数???
create or replace function staffcount(pnumber integer) returns integer
as
$$
select sid
from policy
where policy.pno = pnumber;
$$ language sql;
-- 怎么删除
drop function staffcount(pno integer);
-- 怎么调用
select *
from staffcount(1);



-- Q11
-- procedure怎么用


-- 思路
-- 1. 输入pno,如果pno存在,并且当前vehicle没有同类保险:
-- 2.1 如果当前effective, 创建一条新的记录, status=D, effectivedate=今天, expirydate=today+(old expirydate-old effectivedate), update the old expirydate to today's date (to end the old policy).
--      update coverage
-- 2.2 如果当前不effective, 创建一条新纪录(如上) , 但是expirydate不用管.
--       update coverage

-- drop procedure change_date(pnumber integer); -- 如何删除procedure

CREATE OR REPLACE PROCEDURE change_date(pnumber integer)
    LANGUAGE plpgsql
AS
$$
DECLARE
BEGIN

    if pnumber = 0 then
        raise exception 'gege';
    end if;

    update policy
    set effectivedate='2021-03-12'
    where pno = pnumber;
    COMMIT;
END
$$;

CALL change_date(0);



-- Q12 Triggers怎么用
-- https://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.2/plpgsql-trigger.html
-- trigger 怎么删除?
drop trigger newpolicy on policy;

-- 怎么创建?
create trigger newpolicy
    before insert or update
    on policy
    for each row
execute procedure checkpolicy();

create or replace function checkpolicy() returns trigger as
$$
begin
    if (NEW.agreedvalue < 1000) then
        raise exception 'small buisness, we dont care';
    end if;
    return new;
end ;

$$ language plpgsql;


-- 怎么触发?
insert into policy
VALUES (8, 'G', 'E', '2020-12-16', '2022-12-20', 50000, 'HEHEHE', 5, 7);

select *
from policy;
